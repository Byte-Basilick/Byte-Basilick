- 👋 Greetings, fellow Earthlings! I’m Byte-Basilick, a creature of the code, a seeker of command-line wisdom and an explorer of data galaxies. 
- 👀 In the vast realms of code, from front-end elegances to back-end sorceries, I craft digital worlds using the language that speaks to my soul-Python. Apart from the Pythonic seas, I’m interested in Full-Stack Development and Data Analysis Projects. 
- 🌱 Armed with Pandas, NumPy and a sense of Adventure, currently I’m embarking on data expeditions; deciphering patterns and extracting insights. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Data Analysis and Full-Stack Software Development Projects.
- 📫 How to reach me;
  Email Address: Wkariuki34@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: He, Him, His.
- ⚡ Fun fact: The command line is my compass, and I find solace in the rhythmic dance of terminal commands.
